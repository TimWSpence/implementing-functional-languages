# implementing-functional-languages

Haskell implementation of the code for
[Implementing Functional Languages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/implementing-functional-languages-a-tutorial/).
The book provides a solution in Miranda but the translation to Haskell is pretty straightforward.

### Correlation with the book

Where I've remembered, I've endeavoured to prepend the section number to the relevant commit message
so you should be able to track the evolution of the code in the book as you browse the
commit history. YMMV :)
